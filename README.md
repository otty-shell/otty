    <h4>OTTY - an open-source, terminal-centric workspace that transforms your shell into a true IDE.</h4>
</div>

> **WORK IN PROGRESS**: Now this project is under active development phase, you can support it by providing your thoughts, development ideas and even contributing as a developer.

### About

Developers spend most of their time in the terminal, but modern terminals remain minimal shells. As a result, engineers juggle between the terminal, code editors (AI and not), different dashboards, and SSH clients instead of working in one coherent space.

OTTY rethinks the terminal as the only workspace you need.
