    <h4>OTTY - an open-source, terminal-centric workspace that transforms your shell into a true IDE.</h4>
</div>

> **WORK IN PROGRESS**: Now this project is under active development phase, you can support it by providing your thoughts, development ideas and even contributing as a developer.

### About

OTTY is not just one more blazing fast terminal emulator, OTTY rethinks the terminal itself as the only workspace you need for development or operation your system. 

Developers spend most of their time in the terminal, but modern terminals remain minimal shells. As a result, engineers juggle between the terminal, code editors (AI and not), different dashboards, and SSH clients instead of working in one coherent space.

#### Key features

- Tool management (install / remove tools or sdks, for example: docker, go, rust, zsh, etc)
- SSH connections catalog
- Plugins - extend your workspace with community driven plugins or create new one
- AI agent integration
- Modern terminal UI - besides the standard UI features like tabs or multiplexer, OTTY rethinks the global terminal UI concept and suggest you using your terminal more convinient.
